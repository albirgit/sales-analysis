# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis (2024–2025)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing e-commerce sales data** using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQL (via Pandas SQL queries)**. The goal is to extract **business insights** from raw sales data and present them through **clear analysis and visualizations** — similar to what data analysts and data science interns do in real-world projects.

This project was built as part of **internship preparation** and demonstrates both **data analysis** and **basic data engineering + SQL skills**.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Top Selling Category (by Quantity)
- **Furniture** emerged as the top-selling category by quantity.
- This indicates high customer demand, possibly due to frequent small-ticket purchases or bulk orders.

### 2️⃣ Highest Selling Category (by Sales Value)
- **Home Decor** generated the highest total revenue.
- Although it may sell fewer units than Furniture, its **higher price per item** drives more revenue.

### 3️⃣ Highest Selling Month
- **May 2025** recorded the highest sales.
- This spike may be linked to **seasonal demand**, promotions, or special sales campaigns.

### 4️⃣ City with Highest Profit
- **Bangalore** contributed the highest overall profit.
- This suggests strong purchasing power and a mature e-commerce market in the region.

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- 📈 **Monthly Sales Trend**
- 🧾 **Sales by Category**
- 💳 **Payment Mode Usage Distribution**
- 🌍 **Region-wise Sales Analysis**

Each visualization is accompanied by **clear business insights** explaining what the trend means.

## 🗄️ SQL Analysis
The dataset was analyzed using **SQL-style queries executed through Pandas**, allowing SQL-based analysis directly on DataFrames without creating a separate database file.

### Example Queries:
- Top-selling category by quantity
- Highest revenue-generating category
- Monthly sales aggregation
- Region-wise and city-wise performance

SQL logic was applied using **Pandas + SQL queries**, following an analysis-first workflow commonly used in exploratory data analysis.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Cleaning and analyzing real-world datasets
- Converting CSV data into a SQL database
- Writing analytical SQL queries
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Translating numbers into **business insights**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add **interactive dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau)
- Perform **customer segmentation**
- Apply **time-series forecasting**
- Deploy analysis as a **web dashboard**
